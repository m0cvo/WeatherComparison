# Using node.Js in an asp.net core app to create a graphical representation of temperature data over a given time period.
# The purpose of this is to compare temperature changes year on year in order to form a critical opinion, with evidence,
# of any issues of climate change.  Therefore, data will be added on a daily basis and each chart/graph will cover a period
# of one calender month.
